Examples
========

This page provides a series of examples, tutorials and recipes for using
MSMBuilder.

Each subsection is a notebook.  To open these notebooks in a "live" IPython
session and execute the documentation interactively, you need to download
the repository and start IPython notebook.

If you installed `MSMBuilder` from source, you will need to navigate to
:code:`./examples`. The notebook files for these examples and the notebooks
are available in the top level `examples folder
<https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder/tree/master/examples>`_ on GitHub
as well. In the directory with the notebook files, start an IPython
notebook server:

.. code-block:: python
  
   $ ipython notebook


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :titlesonly:
   
   Intro/Intro
   commandline

.. vim: tw=75
